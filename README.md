# Travetalia

#### Inspiration
Inspired by my semester abroad, I want to create an application that enhance the usersâ€™ travel experience. The experience focuses on personal aspect like putting the travel experience together and logging them. I also plan develop more social aspect like sharing or recommending in the future


#### Features
###### Virtual Scratchmap
A visual map that keep tracks which countries that the user has been to. On top of the map there are location pinpoints to show places/ cities within that countries that the user has visited within that country
